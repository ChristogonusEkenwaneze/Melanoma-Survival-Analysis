## Project Overview

This is an exploratory data analysis of the "Survival from Malignant Melanoma" dataset, focusing on identifying and evaluating prognostic factors that influence survival outcomes.The key variables such as tumor thickness, ulceration, age at operation, and gender are examined to understand their impact on patient survival and highlight patterns that may inform clinical management strategies. 

The analysis includes statistical summaries and visualizations, such as histograms, bar plots, and box plots, to illustrate distributions and trends in survival time, tumor characteristics, and demographic factors. These visuals help uncover data patterns, central tendencies, and potential outliers, setting the stage for  statistical modeling.

### Graphical summaries of melanoma data

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0af14ffb-1523-48e0-b495-be29792344c7)

The histogram above shows a skewed distribution of survival time, with a peak around 2000 days. A long tail to the right indicates that a small number of individuals survived much longer than the majority.

![ii_Patience_status](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2836c4d-ed26-4590-8e6b-d57a6333dff2)

The bar plot shows that most patients stayed alive (status 2). A smaller number of patients died from melanoma (status 1), and an even smaller number died from other causes (status 3). 

![11_Gender_](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f62ebef8-40fb-4bc7-b791-73a39a9b0355)

![ii_age_distribution](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a4788b2-c9e8-42b6-bff0-d878654f9b29)

The histogram shows a right-skewed age distribution at operation, peaking around 50-60 years old. This indicates that most patients were older adults at the time of surgery.

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4bfd83d-3980-4620-af06-6ff863767a7b)

The histogram shows a clear increase in operations performed over time, peaking in the early 1970s. This suggests there may have been advancements in surgical techniques or treatments during this period.

![ii_tumour_thickness](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc406e2c-8d97-4754-b54d-c3c6c78135e0)
![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bad52e7-cfcf-40e4-81d7-f8b0c0a4c0ad)

The box plot shows that most tumour thicknesses are between 0 and 4 mm, with a few outliers extending to 15 mm. This indicates that most tumours are relatively thin, but some cases have significantly thicker tumours.

### Regressional Analysis



## Findings

- Data Scientists earn the highest salaries at $132K, followed by Data Engineers ($102K), while Database Developers and students earn the least.

- Male data professionals earn slightly more ($76K, 51%) than female professionals ($72K, 49%), indicating a minor gender salary gap.

- Python is the most preferred programming language, with significantly more users than C/C++, SQL, and Java.

- Work-life balance satisfaction is moderate (5.74/10), while salary satisfaction is lower (4.27/10), indicating some dissatisfaction with earnings.

- The majority of survey participants are from the United States and India, with fewer respondents from other regions.

## Recommendations

- Employers of data professional can introduce flexible work arrangements, mental health support, and workload management strategies to improve overall job satisfaction..
  
- Companies and employers of data professionals should review compensation structures, offer performance-based incentives, and provide clearer career progression pathways to enhance employee satisfaction.
